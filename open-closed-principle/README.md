# Open Closed Principle

## Introduction
    Software entities (classes,modules,functions, etc.) should be open for extenstion but closed for modification. This means we should be able to change the behavior of a class without changing its source code. 

> [!NOTE]
> We can achive Open-Closed Principle using **Polymorphism** and **Interfaces** (or Abstract classes).

## Open for Extenstion
    The behavior of a software module can be extended without altering its source code.

## Closed for Modification
     Once a module is written and tested, it should not be modified. Instead, new behavior should be added in a way that doesn't impact existing code.
